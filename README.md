# jira-compact.user.css
Css styles to compact [EvaTeam](https://evateam.ru) representation. For example to use with Stylish Chromium and Firefox extension

Any feedback welcome!

## How to use
For Chrome/Chromium browsers I use it in nice [Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=ru) extension.
For firefox may suggest [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/).

You may install it from [userstyles.world site](https://userstyles.world/style/24584) in that case updates will be propagated automatically.

Alternatively you may just follow the [link](https://github.com/Hubbitus/evateam-compact.user.css/raw/refs/heads/main/evateam-compact.user.css).

## What it is

I use [EvaTeam](https://evateam.ru) in my day-to-day job. But even I use wide monitor additionally to notebook their design seems to me very sprawling.

That style will "return" me data on tha page and clean waste spacesâ€¦
